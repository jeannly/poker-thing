# poker-thing
This is just my project to learn about C++ that simulates poker game management. First multi-file project so I can get to know more about the compilation process.

I'm not planning on making it playable since player cards can be seen by everyone but other than that the mechanics are all the same, it's just not in my interests to make a proper Windows interface.

In progress
